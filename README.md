# See_Sort ðŸ‘€

This Kotlin-based application provides an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms using Jetpack Compose. The app uses vertical bars to represent numbers and includes intuitive controls for customizing the visualization.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with animated bar transformations.
- **Adjustable Number of Items**: Use a slider to change the number of bars being sorted.
- **Customizable Sorting Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting process for a deeper understanding.
- **Randomize Numbers**: Click the "Random" button to generate a new set of random numbers for sorting.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Powered by Jetpack Compose, offering a smooth and modern UI experience.
- **Algorithms Supported**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort(soon...)
  - Quick Sort(soon...)
  - And more!

## How It Works

1. **Choose an Algorithm**:
   - Select from the list of available sorting algorithms.
2. **Adjust the Sliders**:
   - Set the number of items (bars) OR click the "Random" button to generate a random list of numbers to sort.
   - Modify the sorting speed to slow down or speed up the animation.
3. **Visualize**:
   - Click "Sort" button to watch the algorithm sort the bars step by step.
